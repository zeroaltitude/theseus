<!-- CLOUD_TASK.md: your whole task. It came with your branch as its first commit, "cloud task (not for main)". Leave this file in place: the maintainer drops it at the merge, as he drops CLOUD_REPORT.md. Your commits go on top of it, on this branch. -->

You are a cloud build session for Theseus, a Rust agent harness: this repository, a Cargo workspace under crates/, with the cockpit (its web app) under cockpit/ and the benchmark adapters under bench/. The repository is public. A maintainer (an AI agent working with the repository's owner) reviews your branch, runs the full gate on the owner's machine, runs any live check that needs the owner's keys, and merges it. You can't reach the owner, the owner's machine, or any issue tracker, so everything you need is in this prompt and in the repository.

**Read first:** the root AGENTS.md (the principles, the workflow, the commit style, the store's version rule, the reader rule), the AGENTS.md of every crate or directory you touch (cockpit/ has its own; bench/ has its README), scripts/AGENTS.md, and .config/nextest.toml. AGENTS.md's "This machine" section describes the owner's machine, not this one. This one is a 4-core VM with 15 GB of RAM and no swap. You run as root, there is no sccache, and nothing else runs here: no operator daemon and no other agents. Use only the tools you need for the code (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep); call no connector or MCP tool.

**Setup** (about 15 minutes, once):
- First, in the foreground and alone, run `cargo --version` and wait for it: it installs the toolchain that
  rust-toolchain.toml names (about 30 seconds). Start no other cargo or rustup command until it is done: two at once
  collide in rustup's download directory. If it fails, run it again.
- `cargo install cargo-nextest --locked` (about 3.5 minutes) and `cargo install cargo-deny --locked`.
- `npm ci` in cockpit/.
- `cargo build --workspace --all-targets` (about 9 minutes cold).
- `cargo deny fetch`, so the gate's deny phase can run offline. If the fetch fails, skip that phase and say so in the report.
- Run long commands in the background and wait for their completion notice. Don't end your turn while work remains, unless a background command will wake you.
- Never delete anything outside the repository and /tmp (nothing under /root/.rustup or /root/.cargo). This
  environment refuses some commands, and three refusals in a row stop the session until a person looks: when one is
  refused, take another route instead of retrying it.

**Known on this VM, and not yours to fix** unless your task names them (other changes fix them):
- About 33 L1 tests fail here: theseus-sandbox's contract tests, its bench's `spawn_100`, and theseusd's sandbox tests. The VM runs as root, and L1 refuses a root daemon's job that has no job cgroup (theseus-pv6i).
- Under load, these timing tests can fail. The flaky list in .config/nextest.toml is empty (since d279767f), so none retries: rerun a failing one alone, and name it in the report. Those marked ‡ and § had fixes joined on 2026-10-06 and 10-07; they are listed because a slow VM can still trip them.
  - theseus-core: `tests_push::a_client_that_stops_reading_hears_what_it_lost_and_catches_up` can pass nextest's 120 s
    kill (theseus-0u6g‡); `learning::tender::tests::a_pool_thread_started_from_the_idle_thread_keeps_its_policy`
    (theseus-1g8j‡); `tests_m3::parallel::a_calls_time_is_its_own_run_not_its_wait_for_the_turn`'s 20 ms bound
    (theseus-b38m‡); `tests_activation_pace::a_clean_stop_ends_the_warm_builds_waits` (theseus-9o2o‡); and
    `term::tests::a_close_leaves_no_child_behind` (theseus-d006‡, a negative assertion: keep its output);
  - theseus-core's aws/hands `runaway_mode_refuses_at_ten_times_the_hours_line` and
    `ten_times_refuses_and_a_cancel_still_runs` fail when a run crosses an hour boundary (they read the wall clock's
    hour, theseus-5a50): rerun them mid-hour;
  - theseus-kernel's `children::a_sweep_reaps_wrappers_and_orphans_and_never_an_owned_child` (theseus-r4hn‡: a count of
    how processes were classed, so its failure is a finding) and theseus-aws-catalog's
    `one_service_decodes_in_under_5_ms` (theseus-rnl3‡: a wall-clock decode bound in a debug build);
  - theseus-discord: tests_outbox's `a_cards_settle_waits_for_its_create_and_edits_it_by_id` (theseus-0bq1‡, sj0t‡),
    `a_refused_pin_leaves_the_board_unpinned_and_edited` (theseus-o2tm‡), `live_edits_of_one_message_coalesce_into_the_last`
    and `a_shared_channels_card_goes_to_the_dm_and_nothing_mentions_anyone` (theseus-3ae1, pb3l), and tests_gateway's
    `a_jev_notice_goes_to_the_owners_dm_and_a_press_there_labels_it` (theseus-3ae1);
  - theseusd: `bench_profile::a_first_byte_timeout_is_retried_inside_the_headless_turn`, which saw 2 model requests
    with transient retries off (theseus-jtrc§, a count: keep its output), and
    `stops::a_stop_of_three_jobs_that_ignore_sigterm_takes_one_grace_and_holds_no_worker`, which read an empty SIGTERM
    file (theseus-y0lm§).
- A negative assertion ("nothing of X reached Y", "no process is left", "no retry") that fails even once is a finding, not a flake: keep its output, name it in the report, and don't retry it away.

Timing tests also fail here more often than on the owner's 16-core machine. Any failure outside the lists above is yours to explain.

**What main holds.** You clone main at 2fd1f654 or later, with **store format 26**. Your clone has v1's milestones, everything batches 8 to 12 joined, and since 2026-10-07:
- the reliability rows (spawn-enosys: proc.run starts where clone3 is refused, and a failed start says why; phantom-jobs; stop-notice; daemon-robust; daemon-memory), budgets-notify (a session's spend limit and loop cap notify instead of restricting) and daily-ceiling (a daemon-wide hard ceiling on model spend per local day, $200 by default);
- the judgment rows: jev-effort (route.v3: Jev picks the reply's effort), route-feedback, bench-routed (a Theseus-as-shipped bench arm), recall-fallback, memory-lookup (the `memory.lookup` tool), recall-in-deadline (recall's vector query inside its 250 ms deadline);
- the tools: terminals (background jobs a terminal started outlive the session; `term.read` until idle), fs-read-big (`fs.read` reads a window of a file over its size cap), web-search-unkeyed;
- the clients: session-states (sessions live, quiet or retired), cli-status (`theseus status`, `wait --any`), seen-shared, work-types (the work view and the shared notification policy in theseus-protocol), push-fixes, client-names, spawn-ask-follow, paste-order (one connection's requests that change a session apply in their arrival order), tui-paste (a paste is one event), discord-silent (today's pings by default, silence per place, a loop's thinking folded into its process message), footer-cost;
- people and people-jev (person categories, handles and merges; `people.v1` proposes people from text: a model extracts, Jev judges), and the cockpit's context explorer and Benchmarks tab;
- **the keel guard** (scripts/keel-guard.py, a gate phase; see "The keel" below).

**Other changes in flight.** These are being built on the owner's machine now, each on its own branch, and join `main` one at a time while you work. Stay out of their areas unless your task needs it; if it does, keep the edit small and say so in the report.
- people-ui: proposals grouped by person in `theseus ontology proposals` and the cockpit's proposals panel; the nightly people sweep and `[people] sweep_usd_per_day` (core judge/people modules, the CLI's ontology command, cockpit ontology views, config/);
- rsi-join: the self-improvement ledger and its kill switch (`halt self`, resume only from the owner), and health's `self` line (core self modules, theseus-protocol's health, the CLI's health render);
- keel-fixes: scripts/gate.sh, scripts/keel-guard.py and its suite (never edit those);
- discord-calls: theseus-discord's lanes and pings (`Lane::process_ping`), theseus-protocol's notices doc, crates/theseus-discord/AGENTS.md;
- client-recall: recall's short-turn query text (core recall.rs), the query pool's size as a config key, a `lane_us` field on the trace's root and a `theseus.rpc.lane.wait` metric (core rpc/), the TUI's SIGINT/SIGQUIT and a paste with no session (crates/theseus-tui/src/main.rs, app.rs), cli-status's leftovers (the CLI's status render);
- bench-dig: benchmark reports under docs/benchmarks/ and small bench/ harness fixes;
- parallel-calls, a local lane: the calls of one response grouped by class and run together (crates/theseus-core/src/toolrun/calls.rs, a `[tools] parallel_runs` cap, the turn bench's `batch` kind, one sentence in the tools note);
- the stopping point's cloud rows, each a cloud session like you, some joined by the time you start (read `git log origin/main`): wave 1's bench-parity (bench/harbor, bench/report), recall-plan-fix (bench/recall), session-dir, output-kept, tool-input-fit, secrets-shapes, fd-soft-fail and cache-fix; and the bench gate's config-split, turn-one-frame, job-handles, health-o1, cli-pages, h2h-bench, bench-fixes, asyncbench, f10, one-turn-compaction, admission-fifo, jobs-burst, money, stop-nudge, memory-flat, index-memory, warm-first-token, recall-offtopic, project-context, proc-env and file-tools-polish. Your task names the siblings whose files meet yours and who owns what.

**Shared files, and how to stay mergeable.** Several of those changes add to the same files, so:
- **The store's format.** The store has one format number, `MANIFEST_FORMAT` (AGENTS.md, "The store's version rule"). If your task adds a field or a variant to a stored record (a new NODE body is one), or a new record kind, bump it by one from main's number as you cloned it (26 on main today, since people), and add the literal sample of the old layout to theseus-core's tests_layouts.rs, as the rule says. A body variant alone owes no old-layout sample. Of the rows in flight, session-dir and project-context may need a bump: if yours needs one, say why. Others may bump it too: the maintainer renumbers at the merge.
- **Files at or near their line ceiling:** read scripts/long-files.txt and `wc -l` the files you touch before you add to them; a Rust file the list doesn't name fails past 2,500 lines. Put new code in new modules: protocol types in a module file of their own, config types under crates/theseus-core/src/config/, compiler code in crates/theseus-core/src/compiler/, turn logic in a module beside turn.rs, tool-run logic in crates/theseus-core/src/toolrun/, tests in a tests_<subject>.rs of their own. In the long files, add only the field, the call, or the `mod` line.
- **The protocol's TypeScript** is in cockpit/src/protocol.gen/, written from the Rust types by theseus-protocol's test (AGENTS.md says how). Regenerate it if you add or change protocol types; the maintainer regenerates it again at the merge. theseus-protocol's ts.rs type-list test sits at clippy's 100-line limit: add a new type to an existing line, never a new line.
- **The config.** The owner's config holds only what differs from the defaults, so every new key needs a default. crates/theseus-core/src/config.rs was 3 lines under its ceiling on 2026-10-10: once config-split has joined (its tests in config/tests.rs) there is room for a key's field line; until then a row that adds a key waits for it, and a new section's type goes in a module under config/ either way. If you add a config section, add it to `theseusd example-config`'s template the way the existing sections are, with its template tests (AGENTS.md).
- **Python under bench/** imports only the standard library, except where the Harbor adapter already imports Harbor, and the gate doesn't run its tests: run them yourself before each commit (bench/README.md says how), and say so in the report. Harbor 0.23.0 needs Python 3.12 or later: where python3 is older, run Harbor's tests in a venv (`python3.12 -m venv /tmp/hvenv && /tmp/hvenv/bin/pip install harbor==0.23.0`); bench/async's Harbor tests also need `ASYNC_HARBOR=1` there. Every benchmark run gets a report in docs/benchmarks/: the maintainer writes those, and no task here runs a benchmark.

**The gate, before every commit:** `TZ=America/Phoenix THESEUS_GATE_NO_BENCH=1 scripts/gate.sh` (it takes its lock itself; leave `THESEUS_GATE_LOCK` unset). When its suite phase fails only on the cases above, run the phases after it yourself (`machine_checks` in scripts/gate.sh), and count the commit green if they pass. Chain commands with `&&`, never `;`. The speed budgets are measured on the owner's machine: leave them alone. A commit that changes only Python, Markdown or task files under bench/ changes nothing the gate builds (its one read there is `bench/theseus-bench.toml`, in theseusd's bench_profile test: leave that file as it is unless your task names it). For such a commit, bench/'s suites, as your task names them, are the gate; run `scripts/gate.sh` itself before your first commit and before your last.

The gate's shape phase fails a Rust file over its line ceiling in scripts/long-files.txt, and one it doesn't list past 2,500 lines. If you would grow a file past its ceiling, split it: never raise a ceiling (the keel, below).

**Commits:**
- One commit per green sub-step, on the branch named below, created from `main` as you cloned it. Don't merge or rebase onto a newer main; the maintainer merges.
- The subject is `area: what changed (<issue id>)`, as in `git log`. The body says what changed and why, in plain words. End each message with the trailer `Co-Authored-By: Claude (cloud session, Opus 5.5) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- You can't sign here: commit without `-S`. The maintainer's merge commit is signed.
- Commit and push each sub-step as soon as it is proved; don't hold commits for the end. Push only your branch, `git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/cloud/20261010-h2h-bench`, at every green point, so nothing is lost if the session ends. Never push to main, never force-push, never delete a branch, and open no pull request.
- No new dependencies: Cargo.lock and the package-lock.json files must not gain a package, and bench/'s Python gains no import beyond the standard library and the Harbor its adapter already uses. If the right design needs one, say so in the report instead.
- Use invented names in fixtures, tests, and commits (AGENTS.md, Item 16). Write nothing about the owner, the owner's machine, accounts, or anyone else.
- **Write no person's name anywhere**: not in code, comments, docs, fixtures, goldens, commit messages or your report. Where a person is meant, write "the owner" (the handle `zeroaltitude` where an identity string is needed), "collaborator" for anyone else; the AI assistant may appear only as "Tabitha/Claude", and your commit trailer names only Claude. The names lane cleared the tree at ea34457e: never bring a name back from memory, an old branch or a fixture you copy.
- Don't edit the spec, docs/status.md, the README, docs/benchmarks.md, docs/benchmarks/, or docs/design/. The maintainer writes those at review. Where a doc should change, say what and where in the report.
- Don't commit half a step. If time runs out mid-step, leave it out and report what you found.

**The report:** when you are done, or at your task's deadline (by the clock, waits included), whichever comes first, write CLOUD_REPORT.md at the repository root. Commit it as the branch's last commit, subject `cloud report (not for main)`, and push. The maintainer reads it from the branch and drops that commit at the merge. For each step it says:
- what you found;
- what you changed (commit hashes);
- how you proved it: the commands and their results, with test counts, the runs under load, and each planted revert and what failed;
- the live check the maintainer should run, as exact commands, and what each should show;
- what is left or uncertain, and any design choice the owner should hear about.

Then the gate's result, naming each failing test and why. Your final message is short (under 1,200 characters): the line `CLOUD REPORT COMPLETE`, then the branch, its head commit, one line per step, and the gate's result.

**The keel.** The gate's keel phase (scripts/keel-guard.py; its docstring lists the rules) fails a range that deletes a test, adds `#[ignore]` or a skip, lowers a test's assertion count, adds an `#[allow]`, raises a bench budget, a spend or loop cap, or a ceiling in scripts/long-files.txt, scripts/shape.sh or .config/nextest.toml, or edits the guard's own files, unless a commit signed by the owner's key acks it. You can't sign, so you can't ack. Rewrite an assertion rather than delete it (a rewritten assertion is not a finding), split a file rather than raise its ceiling, and keep caps. Where your task itself changes a cap or a ceiling, or a test must change its meaning, make that change in a commit of its own whose message says why, and list it in the report under **Keel findings expected** (rule, path, why), so the maintainer can bring it to the owner. Run `python3 scripts/keel-guard.py` before each commit and paste its findings into the report. When the keel phase fails only on findings you listed there, run the gate's later phases yourself (as for the known failures above) and count the commit green.

**Planted reverts:** to prove a test guards a behaviour, plant the bug, show the test fail, then restore the file and `touch` it, so cargo rebuilds it (a restored file with its old mtime keeps the planted build). Run `git status` after every restore.

**Load:** where your task asks for runs under load, use AGENTS.md's recipe. Priority, not count, makes the load: run the test with `nice -n 19`, and beside it four busy loops at nice 0, each `sh -c 'while :; do :; done' &`. Kill the loops by the pids you started, never by a name pattern.

## Your task: h2h-bench, the head-to-head speed bench in the repo: Theseus against Claude Code on one stand-in model, its report regenerated from a run, its counted rows in the gate (theseus-7gir.13, theseus-4w1h)

Branch: `cloud/20261010-h2h-bench`. Every commit's subject carries `theseus-7gir.13`. Deadline for the report: 4 hours
after you start.

**Why this work exists.** The stopping point reruns every benchmark, and its speed row (the rerun plan's order 2) is
"head-to-head speed against Claude Code on the stand-in". The investigation that measured it (2026-10-08) ran a rig
outside the repo, so it cannot be rerun or reviewed. Its method, to rebuild here:
- **One stand-in model for both harnesses**, speaking the Anthropic Messages API (streamed SSE, chunked, keep-alive,
  TCP_NODELAY) on 127.0.0.1; scripted per prompt (rules matched on the turn's opening user text; the step is the
  count of tool results since); a known time to first byte (300 ms unless a row says otherwise) and 8 chunks 25 ms
  apart; each harness's own tool names (Read/Edit/Bash for Claude Code; fs_read/fs_edit/proc_run for Theseus) doing
  identical work. Every request logged on `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`: arrival, first byte sent, last byte sent, sizes, tools,
  model. A request without tools is a "side" request (Claude Code's small-model calls).
- **A pty driver**: each interactive surface in a 120x40 pty; it types and presses keys and stamps when a marker first
  appears in the ANSI-stripped output (cursor-forward rendered as spaces), on the same clock; each turn's reply
  carries a per-run unique marker; RSS and CPU of the process tree plus the daemon sampled from `/proc`.
- **One-shot runs**: spawn, first output, marker, exit; `wait4` for CPU and peak RSS; joined with the stand-in's log
  by time; A/B interleaved; a reset hook between runs.
- **Claude Code** pinned to a version, in a scratch HOME and `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` at the
  stand-in, a dummy key, `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER`, `DISABLE_TELEMETRY`, `DISABLE_ERROR_REPORTING`,
  `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC`, the scratch config marked onboarded; interactive with
  `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, one-shots with `-p`. No real model call: $0.
- **Theseus**: scratch daemons of a release build, each with its own state dir and socket, with index, recall, judge,
  LSP, Discord and web off and the tool policy open (as Claude Code's bypass mode).

The rows it measured (keep these names: the report and the omnibus use them): T1 start to a ready prompt; T2 typed
prompt to the request leaving; T3 model's first byte to the first text on screen; T4 per tool call (model's last
byte to the next request), a read and a shell command; T5 resume of a long session to a ready prompt, and one-shot
resume to the request; T6 CPU per turn; T7 idle CPU and memory; T8 the same rows under neighbour IO; plus a 3-tool
coding task end to end and the bytes of the first request.

theseus-4w1h rides here: the README's speed table promises "Harness overhead per turn: under 5 ms" marked "to be
measured", and the cockpit's speed wall reads 194 ms on a store copy (debug turns, WSL fsyncs: commits ~64 ms, the
rest ~132 ms). Define it (the harness's own work, or everything but the model and the tools: pick one, say why, and
make the README and the speed wall read the same definition), measure it on a release build with the stand-in, split
it into commits, compiles, admission and the rest, and replace "to be measured" with the number and its definition.

**What to build:**
1. **`bench/h2h/`**: the drivers above (Python, standard library only), a README that says how to run each row, and
   unit tests for the parsers and the joins (stand-in log against screen stamps) on recorded fixtures.
2. **The stand-in in Rust.** Extend `theseus-sim fake-model` (crates/theseus-sim/src/fake_model.rs) to pace deltas
   (time to first byte, chunk count and spacing per rule) and serve keep-alive; today it sends every event in one write,
   so first-token rows are impossible. Its log in the shape above. Python's stand-in is not needed if this serves both
   harnesses; say which you chose.
3. **The report generator**: a run writes `docs/benchmarks/<date>-head-to-head-speed.md` with a `.json`, and SVG
   charts through bench/report's palette (validated, light and dark), answer first. The maintainer runs it; you commit
   the generator and its test on a fixture run, not a published report.
4. **The counted rows in the gate**: syncs before the first byte, the first request's bytes (<= 40 KB with the default
   tools), and no timer between a delta and its write: judged (counts, not times). The timed rows are recorded, never
   judged, because the gate runs debug builds beside neighbour load (the owner's decision D-6). Adding a counted check
   is no keel finding; raising an existing budget is.

**Improve, never max:** the rows measure what a person feels; no rule is tuned to make a row pass, and the report
states its threats (one machine, the stand-in's timing, load during the run).

**Doing more, filing less** (the owner, 2026-10-10): a defect you find in code you are already in, fix it here with a
test and name it in the report.

**Siblings.** turn-one-frame and tool-loop-frames lower the sync counts your counted rows judge: write the rows so a
lower count passes and the budget is today's measured count (they lower it at their joins). The F10 driver (row f10)
also drives a pty: if both exist when you finish, say whether they should share a module; don't merge them now.

**Tests:** the drivers' parsers on fixtures; the fake model's pacing (first byte and chunk spacing within a few ms,
keep-alive reuse) and its log; the generator on a fixture run; the counted rows on a scratch daemon. Plant a revert
for each counted row (an extra sync before the first byte, a delta held behind a timer) and record what caught it.

**Live check on this VM:** the Theseus half of every row on a release build (T1 to T7), pasted with the load average;
if a Claude Code binary is available here, one row of its half, else say so. Write the full run's commands for the
maintainer, whose machine has the pinned Claude Code.

Run the gate before every commit; commit CLOUD_REPORT.md as the branch's last commit, and end with a short final
message starting `CLOUD REPORT COMPLETE`.
