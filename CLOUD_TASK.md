<!-- CLOUD_TASK.md: your whole task. It came with your branch as its first commit, "cloud task (not for main)". Leave this file in place: the maintainer drops it at the merge, as he drops CLOUD_REPORT.md. Your commits go on top of it, on this branch. -->

You are a cloud build session for Theseus, a Rust agent harness: this repository, a Cargo workspace under crates/, with the cockpit (its web app) under cockpit/ and the benchmark adapters under bench/. The repository is public. A maintainer (an AI agent working with the repository's owner) reviews your branch, runs the full gate on the owner's machine, runs any live check that needs the owner's keys, and merges it. You can't reach the owner, his machine, or any issue tracker, so everything you need is in this prompt and in the repository.

**Read first:** the root AGENTS.md (the principles, the workflow, the commit style, the store's version rule, the reader rule), the AGENTS.md of every crate or directory you touch (cockpit/ has its own; bench/ has its README), scripts/AGENTS.md, and .config/nextest.toml. AGENTS.md's "This machine" section describes the owner's machine, not this one. This one is a 4-core VM with 15 GB of RAM and no swap. You run as root, there is no sccache, and nothing else runs here: no operator daemon and no other agents. Use only the tools you need for the code (Bash, Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep); call no connector or MCP tool.

**Setup** (about 15 minutes, once):
- First, in the foreground and alone, run `cargo --version` and wait for it: it installs the toolchain that
  rust-toolchain.toml names (about 30 seconds). Start no other cargo or rustup command until it is done: two at once
  collide in rustup's download directory. If it fails, run it again.
- `cargo install cargo-nextest --locked` (about 3.5 minutes) and `cargo install cargo-deny --locked`.
- `npm ci` in cockpit/.
- `cargo build --workspace --all-targets` (about 9 minutes cold).
- `cargo deny fetch`, so the gate's deny phase can run offline. If the fetch fails, skip that phase and say so in the report.
- Run long commands in the background and wait for their completion notice. Don't end your turn while work remains, unless a background command will wake you.
- Never delete anything outside the repository and /tmp (nothing under /root/.rustup or /root/.cargo). This
  environment refuses some commands, and three refusals in a row stop the session until a person looks: when one is
  refused, take another route instead of retrying it.

**Known on this VM, and not yours to fix** unless your task names them (other changes fix them):
- About 33 L1 tests fail here: theseus-sandbox's contract tests, its bench's `spawn_100`, and theseusd's sandbox tests. The VM runs as root, and L1 refuses a root daemon's job that has no job cgroup (theseus-pv6i).
- theseus-core's `tests_output::the_cores_output_matches_its_golden` fails under this VM's UTC clock, because two wake lines carry the offset's sign (theseus-ig6n*). The gate line below sets `TZ=America/Phoenix` for it; set the same when you run the suite yourself, and commit only the golden lines your change moves.
- Under load, these timing tests can fail, and none is on the flaky list: rerun it alone, and name it in the report. Batch 9's branches, reviewed and joining main today, fix the ones marked *; batch 10's sibling sessions (below) work on those marked ‡; batch 8's timing-flakes is on main and fixed those marked † (their subjects name theseus-cs71, ynia, 1n2y and qjd6), so those four don't fail on your clone.
  - theseus-core: the output golden's 30 s wait for "wake due" under CPU starvation (theseus-23wh*);
    `tests_m3::parallel::a_cancel_during_a_batch_leaves_no_call_dispatched` (theseus-t2yb*);
    `tests_judge::a_failing_jev_is_recorded_by_its_class_and_changes_no_turn`'s 3 s bound (theseus-vbju*);
    `tests_route`'s verdicts that come `late` under starvation (theseus-biy3*); `tests_lsp_edits::the_block_adds_no_frame`
    (theseus-xx6w*); `term::tests::sh_runs_a_command_and_ctrl_c_interrupts_one` (theseus-ynia†: typed-ahead input can
    land on the prompt line; it fails alone too, about one run in two on this VM) and
    `term::tests::python3s_repl_computes_on_the_screen` (theseus-1n2y†); `telemetry::tests::a_failed_continuation_is_counted_as_a_failed_turn_is`
    (theseus-qjd6†: the exporter's retry counted as a fourth trace);
    `tests_push::a_client_that_stops_reading_hears_what_it_lost_and_catches_up` can pass nextest's 120 s kill
    (theseus-0u6g‡); `learning::tender::tests::a_pool_thread_started_from_the_idle_thread_keeps_its_policy`
    (theseus-1g8j‡); `tests_m3::parallel::a_calls_time_is_its_own_run_not_its_wait_for_the_turn`'s 20 ms bound
    (theseus-b38m‡); `tests_activation_pace::a_clean_stop_ends_the_warm_builds_waits` (theseus-9o2o‡); and
    `term::tests::a_close_leaves_no_child_behind` (theseus-d006‡, a negative assertion: keep its output);
  - theseus-store's `tests_pages::a_filtered_page_equals_the_scans_answer` can pass nextest's 120 s kill (theseus-hohs*);
  - theseus-kernel's `children::a_sweep_reaps_wrappers_and_orphans_and_never_an_owned_child` (theseus-r4hn‡: a count of
    how processes were classed, so its failure is a finding) and theseus-aws-catalog's
    `one_service_decodes_in_under_5_ms` (theseus-rnl3‡: a wall-clock decode bound in a debug build);
  - theseus-discord's tests_outbox: `a_cards_settle_waits_for_its_create_and_edits_it_by_id` (theseus-0bq1‡, sj0t‡) and
    `a_refused_pin_leaves_the_board_unpinned_and_edited` (theseus-o2tm‡);
  - theseusd's `job_approval::a_cancel_kills_the_jobs_whole_tree_a_setsid_descendant_too` (theseus-cs71†: a 1.5 s wall
    bound on the cancel's round trip).
- A negative assertion ("nothing of X reached Y", "no process is left") that fails even once is a finding, not a flake: keep its output, name it in the report, and don't retry it away.

Timing tests also fail here more often than on the owner's 16-core machine. A test on .config/nextest.toml's flaky list that passes on a retry is fine (daemon-proofs, on main since d279767f, emptied the list: theseusd's stop on a SIGTERM or a SIGINT, theseus-xbtr*, and a clean stop that closes the index). Any other failure is yours to explain.

**What main holds.** You clone main at d279767f or later, with **store format 23**. Your clone has, besides v1's milestones and batch 9's base (4a449460: route's gaps, situations, the reader rule's closures, memory's paced warm build and consolidation's heading rule, and bench/'s measured arms):
- **batch 8's joins (2026-10-05 and 06):**
  - timing-flakes and telemetry3: four timing tests fixed at their causes; the `theseus.cancel` metric, the index tender's gauges and restarts;
  - cli-tests and history-pages: health's 1-hour words, `judge prove`'s bytes, `watch`'s last line; `after` and `before` on the history reads, and a node's short id;
  - turn-stack, queue-frames and smalls: the turn's future boxed at `TurnRunner::run`; a late result's wake in its turn's end frame and a completion's `execution.queued` row; the secrets board's settle race, musl's `time_t`, the TUI's message order, a budget question's `loop.ended`;
  - wal-mark-skip, crash-hold and durability-on: a start skips the WAL directory's sync when a mark vouches; a crashed call's held reservation booked as spent; the durability sessions list only their prefix, and health's durability line in every surface;
  - **soul-import (79be3213): `theseus import openclaw|list|erase`, imported sessions with their provenance, erase by tag, recall's provenance; store format 23** (core import/, node.rs's bodies, recall.rs, rpc/import.rs, the index's tender and extract);
  - learning-fixes (21bf5454): replay and the loop share one rule for a lean's rightness, the audit's requests run off its low thread, the prove names a learned loop version's placement (learning/, rpc/judge_prove.rs);
  - discord-live (6496ce34): Discord's bindings file read while the daemon runs (a place added, changed or removed binds, updates or unbinds with no restart), and a lane's message maps bounded (theseus-discord runtime/live.rs, runtime.rs, courier.rs);
- **batch 9's joins (2026-10-06):**
  - the bench stack: the async record's spend and calls, the recall bench's retraction rule and its overhead plan (bench/ only);
  - voice-turns (f33f0eca): a barge-in held until the words over it decide, a reply waiting for the floor, `Cut` and `Resumed` (theseus-voice);
  - scrub-escaped, gate-tests, approvals-batch (2b342594, bd3eb769, 25b0578f): a secret printed JSON-escaped is withheld (core scrub/escaped.rs); the gate's layers held by tests and `policy.explain` naming L3; a declined call ends its batch's waits, and a call is found by its own response (core toolrun/calls.rs, `resume::calls_of`, the core golden);
  - judge-tests and judge-reads (fb1133dc, d28bfc4b): judge tests; `judge.list` pages back from the newest judgment with a `more` floor (the CLI prints `M+`), the notices' brake reads today's rows, the learning rules skip judgments whose windows closed (core rpc/judge.rs, judge/notice.rs, learning/system.rs);
  - memory-tests and telemetry-tests (a8f4b27c, 2bf9e7d3): a search during the paced warm build answers `building` at once, a compaction summary's call reserved on the estimate's upper bound, `Adjacent::paces`; tests of the daemon's own telemetry path through `install_telemetry`, and the index gauges by the tender's latest answer (core recall/activation.rs, turn/compaction.rs, provider.rs's `Scripted::BilledBy`, tests_activation_*.rs, tests_compaction.rs, telemetry tests).
  - core-waits, route-tests, daemon-proofs (2e592804, 857ab09a, d279767f, joined 11:59 on 10-06): four core tests fixed at their causes (the golden's wake set 20 s past its turn and its UTC offset's sign masked, so the gate line's TZ can go), route's tests proof against load and a routed turn's trace root naming the model it ran on, a `--stdio` daemon's pipes relayed by threads so its stop drops the runtime (theseusd stdio.rs), the lifecycle bench's `cancel` phase, the flaky list emptied;

**Other changes in flight.** A few other changes are reviewed and merging into `main` while you work, one at a time on the owner's machine. Stay out of their areas unless your task needs it. If it does, keep the edit small and say so in the report.
- judge-turn-cost (batch 9, in a fix round with batch 10's judge-sink): the judge's sink writing between turns and flushing at a stop, the ladder's first read off the turn path, a judge-on turn bench (core judge/ladder/, judge/lineage.rs, judge/mod.rs, judge/sink.rs, rpc/packs.rs, theseus-sim perf).

These are other cloud sessions like you, batch 10, each on its own branch:
- imported-skip: session lists skip imported sessions without reading them (theseus-7087);
- voice-heard: the next voice turn says what was heard, cut and never said; replies shaped for speech; a failed voice turn said aloud;
- voice-echo: an echo and a closing "yes" told apart from a real answer in a voice call;
- judge-sink: judge-turn-cost's sink keeping its clock across a backlog and writing its batch at a stop (theseus-s1am);
- bench-pi: Pi as the benchmarks' fourth arm (theseus-jp9p; bench/harbor/pi_agent.py, bench/report/, bench/README.md);
- discord-bound: a lane forgets a turn's message ids when the renderer drops the turn, and the renderer's own maps are bounded the same way (theseus-6809; theseus-discord courier.rs, render/, runtime.rs's place actor);
- discord-watch: the bindings file's watch retries a failed bind, keeps the start's note, waits out a torn save and keeps the owners' DM order (theseus-u6v6; runtime/live.rs, tests_live.rs);
- discord-tests: theseus-discord's load flakes at their causes, a binding's event loop ended at the stop, `refuse_unbound` under the lanes' lock (theseus-yduk; tests_outbox.rs, runtime.rs);
- daemon-stops: a `--stdio` daemon stops on the `shutdown` method, a restart in place drops its runtime first, an import or erase stops between frames, the manifest's upgrade syncs the log's directory first (theseus-yg1y; theseusd main.rs, core rpc/import.rs and import/write.rs, theseus-store store.rs);
- cancel-fast: `execution.cancel`'s round trip, its stop waits event-driven and its frames fewer (theseus-dwoj; theseus-kernel job.rs and tree.rs, core cancel.rs and rpc/driver.rs);
- flake-causes: five tests that fail under load fixed at their causes (theseus-d006; term/tests.rs, tests_push.rs, learning/tender.rs's tests, theseus-kernel's children test, theseus-aws-catalog's decode test);
- learned-shadow: `pack.promote` warns while a learned version stands in shadow, the prove's window line names one standing from before it, the learning cut's clock (theseus-nwa5; rpc/packs.rs, rpc/judge_prove.rs, learning/system.rs);
- voice-holds: the hold and the floor bounded, two turns.rs gaps, a waiting report's `Cut` at the call's end (theseus-aq4t; theseus-voice engine.rs, tests/turns.rs);
- scrub-encodings: the scrubber's twice-escaped JSON, YAML and repr escapes, and base64 inside an escaped string (theseus-nlvx; core scrub.rs, scrub/escaped.rs);
- budget-upper: a turn's own call reserved on the estimate's upper bound, memory's telemetry in `Core::build`, the warm build's stop test (theseus-ps9i; turn.rs's two reservation lines, rpc/mod.rs, tests_activation_pace.rs);
- core-gaps: a failed routed turn counted where it ran, and four core test gaps (theseus-udzb; rpc/methods.rs's `count_failed_turn`, tests_route*.rs, tests_m3.rs, tests_audit.rs, tests_stack.rs);
- bench-bounds: bench/'s sampler bounds, the recall scorer's retraction rule, and a daemon under its planned overhead (theseus-ufe5; bench/ only).

**Shared files, and how to stay mergeable.** Several of those changes add to the same files, so:
- **The store's format.** The store has one format number, `MANIFEST_FORMAT` (AGENTS.md, "The store's version rule"). If your task adds a field or a variant to a stored record (a new NODE body is one), or a new record kind, bump it by one from main's number as you cloned it (23 on main today, since soul-import), and add the literal sample of the old layout to theseus-core's tests_layouts.rs, as the rule says. A body variant alone owes no old-layout sample. Others bump it too: the maintainer renumbers at the merge.
- **Files at or near their line ceiling** (scripts/long-files.txt): at it, crates/theseus-protocol/src/lib.rs (2,715) and crates/theseus-discord/src/render.rs (3,001); near it, crates/theseus/src/render.rs (3,099 of 3,100), crates/theseus-kernel/src/kernel.rs (3,025 of 3,030), crates/theseus-core/src/compiler.rs (2,546 of 2,560), crates/theseus-core/src/config.rs (2,887 of 2,910), crates/theseus-core/src/turn.rs (3,496 of 3,523), crates/theseus-discord/src/runtime.rs (3,418 of 3,500) and crates/theseus-core/src/tests_m3.rs (7,800 of 8,050). A Rust file the list doesn't name fails past 2,500 lines; near that today are theseus-core's telemetry/tests.rs (2,491) and toolrun.rs (2,418), theseus-sim's kernel_sim.rs (2,465), theseus-store's wal.rs (2,430) and theseus-kernel's tests.rs (2,384). Other changes add to them as well. Put new code in new modules: protocol types in a module file of their own, config types under crates/theseus-core/src/config/, compiler code in crates/theseus-core/src/compiler/, turn logic in a module beside turn.rs, tool-run logic in crates/theseus-core/src/toolrun/, tests in a tests_<subject>.rs of their own. In the long files, add only the field, the call, or the `mod` line.
- **The protocol's TypeScript** is in cockpit/src/protocol.gen/, written from the Rust types by theseus-protocol's test (AGENTS.md says how). Regenerate it if you add or change protocol types; the maintainer regenerates it again at the merge. theseus-protocol's ts.rs type-list test sits at clippy's 100-line limit: add a new type to an existing line, never a new line.
- **The config.** The owner's config holds only what differs from the defaults, so every new key needs a default. If you add a config section, add it to `theseusd example-config`'s template the way the existing sections are, with its template tests (AGENTS.md).
- **Python under bench/** imports only the standard library, except where the Harbor adapter already imports Harbor, and the gate doesn't run its tests: run them yourself before each commit (bench/README.md says how), and say so in the report. Harbor 0.23.0 needs Python 3.12 or later: where python3 is older, run Harbor's tests in a venv (`python3.12 -m venv /tmp/hvenv && /tmp/hvenv/bin/pip install harbor==0.23.0`).

**The gate, before every commit:** `TZ=America/Phoenix THESEUS_GATE_NO_BENCH=1 scripts/gate.sh` (it takes its lock itself; leave `THESEUS_GATE_LOCK` unset). When its suite phase fails only on the cases above, run the phases after it yourself (`machine_checks` in scripts/gate.sh), and count the commit green if they pass. Chain commands with `&&`, never `;`. The speed budgets are measured on the owner's machine: leave them alone. A commit that changes only Python, Markdown or task files under bench/ changes nothing the gate builds (its one read there is `bench/theseus-bench.toml`, in theseusd's bench_profile test: leave that file as it is). For such a commit, bench/'s suites, as your task names them, are the gate; run `scripts/gate.sh` itself before your first commit and before your last.

The gate's shape phase fails a Rust file over its line ceiling in scripts/long-files.txt, and one it doesn't list past 2,500 lines. If you grow a file past its ceiling, split it, or raise the ceiling in the same commit and say why.

**Commits:**
- One commit per green sub-step, on the branch named below, created from `main` as you cloned it. Don't merge or rebase onto a newer main; the maintainer merges.
- The subject is `area: what changed (<issue id>)`, as in `git log`. The body says what changed and why, in plain words. End each message with the trailer `Co-Authored-By: Claude (cloud session, Sonnet 5.5) <noreply@anthropic.com>`.
- You can't sign here: commit without `-S`. The maintainer's merge commit is signed.
- Commit and push each sub-step as soon as it is proved; don't hold commits for the end. Push only your branch, `git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/cloud/20261006-discord-watch`, at every green point, so nothing is lost if the session ends. Never push to main, never force-push, never delete a branch, and open no pull request.
- No new dependencies: Cargo.lock and the package-lock.json files must not gain a package, and bench/'s Python gains no import beyond the standard library and the Harbor its adapter already uses. If the right design needs one, say so in the report instead.
- Use invented names in fixtures, tests, and commits (AGENTS.md, Item 16). Write nothing about the owner, his machine, his accounts, or anyone else.
- Don't edit the spec, docs/status.md, the README, docs/benchmarks.md, or docs/design/. The maintainer writes those at review. Where a doc should change, say what and where in the report.
- Don't commit half a step. If time runs out mid-step, leave it out and report what you found.

**The report:** when you are done, or at your task's deadline (by the clock, waits included), whichever comes first, write CLOUD_REPORT.md at the repository root. Commit it as the branch's last commit, subject `cloud report (not for main)`, and push. The maintainer reads it from the branch and drops that commit at the merge. For each step it says:
- what you found;
- what you changed (commit hashes);
- how you proved it: the commands and their results, with test counts, the runs under load, and each planted revert and what failed;
- the live check the maintainer should run, as exact commands, and what each should show;
- what is left or uncertain, and any design choice the owner should hear about.

Then the gate's result, naming each failing test and why. Your final message is short (under 1,200 characters): the line `CLOUD REPORT COMPLETE`, then the branch, its head commit, one line per step, and the gate's result.

**Planted reverts:** to prove a test guards a behaviour, plant the bug, show the test fail, then restore the file and `touch` it, so cargo rebuilds it (a restored file with its old mtime keeps the planted build). Run `git status` after every restore.

**Load:** where your task asks for runs under load, use AGENTS.md's recipe. Priority, not count, makes the load: run the test with `nice -n 19`, and beside it four busy loops at nice 0, each `sh -c 'while :; do :; done' &`. Kill the loops by the pids you started, never by a name pattern.

---
## Your task: the bindings file's live watch, four fixes and two tests: a place whose bind failed is retried, the board's "waits for the next start" note holds until a start, a torn save is not acted on, DMs keep the file's order, and tests that a changed place is updated in place and a retired lane is not bound (theseus-u6v6; also theseus-btt4, theseus-sn2z, theseus-nz3q, theseus-02bq, theseus-88cp)

Branch: `cloud/20261006-discord-watch`. Every commit's subject carries the id of the issue it fixes. Deadline for the
report: 5 hours after you start.

**Background.** Since discord-live's join, theseus-discord reads its bindings file while the daemon runs
(runtime/live.rs): `watch` stats the file every `PERIOD` (2 s) and reads it when its stamp (mtime, size, inode)
moved; `Shared::apply` diffs places by key against the last file applied (`bound`): a removed place loses its routes
and actor and its lane is retired (it ends between posts); an added one binds as a start binds it (`bind`); a
changed one is updated in place (`rebind`: routes, `PlaceMsg::Rebound`, `LaneMsg::Label`); `waits` puts what waits for
the next start on the board's detail. Each item below is one commit with its test and its plant.

**Read first:** theseus-discord's AGENTS.md; runtime/live.rs whole; runtime.rs's `Shared` (`lanes`, `retired`,
`routes`, `refuse_unbound`, `binds`, `approval_dm`, `start_place`, `session_for`, `open_session`) and `Routes::dms`;
courier.rs's `operator_channel` (about 1111); rpc_client.rs; tests_live.rs whole, and tests_gateway.rs's `Rig`
(`start_on`, which waits for `#lab` and ana's DM to bind, `until`, `say`, `posted`, `ledger`; read only);
theseus-core outbox.rs's `to_operator` (a notice's `fallback`); theseus-sim fake_discord.rs (`hold_writes_containing`,
`set_nonce_window_ms`).

**What to build,** each a green commit:
1. **theseus-u6v6: a place whose bind failed is retried.** `apply` says a failed `bind` once (`discord.error`, `op:
   "bind place"`), then the watch sets `bound = new`, the failed place included: the next change diffs it as bound,
   and a change of its own entry goes to `rebind`, which finds no actor. Meanwhile it has a lane but no actor, so
   `binds` names it. Keep failed keys apart (out of `bound`, or a set in `watch`) and retry them each tick until they
   bind, with no further save, the failure said once on the board's detail meanwhile; a key that binds, or that the
   file drops, leaves the set. A retried `[[dm]]` must not land in
   `Routes::dms` twice (`bind_dm`'s kept-lane path pushes). Test: `#pier` added live while the binding's next
   `session.open` is refused once (a test seam in rpc_client.rs or the binding's code, never the core's): the detail
   says why; then `#pier` binds within two periods, one bind notice, no second save. **Plant:** the failed key kept in
   `bound`, as main does.
2. **theseus-btt4: the note holds until a start makes it true.** `waits(old, new)` compares the last two files, so
   "the voice channels wait for the next start" drops at the next unrelated change, and a voice channel added then
   removed says it waits though nothing does. Keep the bindings the start bound (`started`: what `serve` passes the
   watch) and compute `waits(&started, &new)`. Test: a `voice = true` channel added: the detail names the voice
   channels; #lab's users changed: it still does; the voice channel removed: it no longer does. **Plant:** the
   comparison against the last file, as main has it.
3. **theseus-sn2z: a torn save is not acted on.** A save stat'ed while torn at a table boundary parses (TOML is
   line-based) and names fewer places: the watch unbinds the places past the tear and binds them again a tick later;
   meanwhile their posts are refused and their messages unanswered (seen live: a 198-byte prefix of a 406-byte file,
   held 5 s, took two places out of health). Act on a stamp only once it has held still one period, and treat a stamp
   whose mtime is younger than the period as unsettled, re-read at the next tick even if equal (which also closes the
   racy-stat gap of two same-size writes in one mtime tick). Test: a valid prefix (cut after a table), the watch
   seen to stat it (a count of its stats visible to tests, never a sleep that hopes a tick passed), then the rest
   inside the period: no place leaves health, no post is refused, the full file is bound. **Plant:** act on any moved
   stamp at once, as main does. Say the latency it adds (a change binds within two periods, not one) and what it
   leaves (a writer paused longer than a period mid-save still tears). Whether removals should wait longer is a
   question for the report.
4. **theseus-nz3q: DMs in the file's order.** `start_dm_lane` and `bind_dm`'s kept-lane path push onto `Routes::dms`,
   so a `[[dm]]` added or put back live goes last, where a start fills `dms` in the file's order; `approval_dm` sends
   approvals and operator notices to the first owner's DM in that order: another owner's, until a restart. After a
   change, rebuild `dms` in `apply` in the new file's order, keeping only DMs that are bound. Test: the rig's owners
   are ana and ben (`cfg.places.owner`): a file with ana's `[[dm]]`, then ben's; ana's removed and put back; an
   operator notice (`core.outbox.to_operator`) goes to ana's DM. **Plant:** the push, as now.
5. **theseus-02bq: a changed place keeps its turn and its messages (a test).** A planted unbind-and-bind passes every
   test today: the existing test checks the label, the session and who may drive the place, which a stop and start
   keep too. Test: a turn mid-way in #lab (its text and a tool line posted: a call waiting for approval, or a write
   held by the fake), the file rewritten meanwhile with #lab's users changed, then the turn carried to its end: each
   message once, the reply edited to its final text and the tool line to its end (close the fake's nonce window, so a
   re-created message would show).
   **Plant:** in `apply`, `self.unbind(k, &w.label()).await; let _ = self.bind(p).await;` for `self.rebind(k, p)`:
   the test fails; say which assertion.
6. **theseus-88cp: a retired lane is not bound (a test).** `Shared::binds` leaves out a retired lane, so a notice
   whose place the file dropped is refused while that place's lane still drains (`operator_channel`: "… is not one
   this daemon's bindings file names"). Test: ana's DM taken out live first (the rig starts with it, and ana and ben
   are both owners: keep neither's DM); a post for #dock held mid-write (`hold_writes_containing`, as tests_live's
   in-flight test does); #dock removed; an operator notice falling back to #dock (`to_operator` with #dock's session)
   is refused with that reason while the lane is held, and nothing but the held post reaches #dock. **Plant:**
   `binds` back to `lanes.contains_key(target)`.

Tests go in tests_live.rs (301 lines) or a new tests_*.rs beside it (its `mod` line in lib.rs); a rig helper goes in
an `impl Rig` of your file, as tests_live.rs does, never in tests_gateway.rs. The watch's ticks are wall-clock: each
test waits on state, with a bound well past two periods.

**Proof, offline:** each new test fails on its plant and passes restored (quote each failure; restore with a fresh
mtime, then `git status`); every `tests_live` test; each new test 5 times under load; theseus-discord's suite whole;
the workspace suite once. The watch starts in `serve`, after the places: say nothing here is on the start path or
a turn's path.

**The live check is the maintainer's.** A scratch daemon on `theseus-sim discord rig`'s stand-ins, a fresh state
dir, invented names. Exact commands for:
1. sn2z: the file's bytes up to a table boundary written and flushed, the rest held 1 s, then written: no place
   leaves health, nothing refused; held 5 s: what it shows.
2. btt4: a voice channel added live, then another place's users changed: health's detail names the voice channels
   until a restart.
3. nz3q: two owners' DMs, the first removed and put back: a shared place's approval card goes to the first DM in the
   file.

**Leave alone:**
- discord-bound (batch 10): courier.rs, render.rs and render/, runtime.rs's turn drop and `Place::rebind`;
- discord-tests (batch 10): tests_outbox.rs, runtime.rs's `refuse_unbound` and `event_loop`;
- judge-sink: tests_gateway.rs; voice-heard: runtime/voice.rs and runtime/voice/;
- runtime.rs (3,418 of 3,500 lines): a field or a call only, if a fix needs one.
